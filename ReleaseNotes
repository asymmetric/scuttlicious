Change Log:
version 0.1:  
initial version based on Patrick H. Lauke's del.icio.us post 0.4

version 0.1.1:
made it compatible with Firefox 1.5
there's a bug with the version.   The submit bookmark dialog doesn't disappear by automatically after one posts a bookmark successfully.  It disappears when any part of it is clicked, or when you switch windows.  This bug is specific to Firefox 1.5

version 0.1.2(1-2-2006):
fixed the bug introduced in last version

version 0.1.3(1-2-2006):
re-constructed the folder structure such that this extension can be easily developed/debugged without restarting Firefox. 
This version only works with Firefox version 1.5.

version 0.2(1-3-2006):
Added the ability to set the privacy level of the bookmark being posted.  Note that this feature only works if your Scuttl-powered site supports it
This version only works with Firefox version 1.5.
Because of the restructure of the folder layout in previous version, I could debug this extension without re-installing the extension file and restarting Firefox.  That's why I could make and test changes quickly and released it much sooner.

version 0.2.1(4-16-2006):
Localize this extension in Simplified Chinese(zh-CN), Traditional Chinese(zh-TW)
Localization in Japanese(ja-JP) by Tadashi Jokagi
